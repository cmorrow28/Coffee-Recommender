# Dataset Explained

This dataset is taken from the Coffee Quality Institute (2018), and includes information relating to the provenance, growing conditions, processing methods, varietals and <em>cupping</em> scores (and therefore quality) of arabica and robusta coffee beans.

<em>Cupping</em> is a standardized method used to evaluate and compare the flavors and aromas of coffee beans. It's a practice commonly used by coffee professionals, roasters, and enthusiasts to assess the quality of coffee. Unless you’re a coffee professional, most people who are cupping are simply doing so to better understand a coffee—and to see if they like or dislike a coffee’s profile.

## What is evaluated in a coffee cupping?

When cupping, there are 11 components that are evaluated, 8 of which are included in this analysis:

### <em>Aroma</em>
A coffee’s “aroma” is its smell after water is added.

### <em>Flavor</em>
“Flavor” encompasses a coffee’s principal character or its main flavor notes. Some might refer to this as the “mid-range” notes, in between a coffee’s “top” notes (which are usually brighter, acidic notes) and its lower “base” notes (which tend to be comprised of notes such as, chocolate, nut, or caramel). 

### <em>Aftertaste</em>
A coffee’s ”aftertaste” is evaluated based on the length that positive flavors linger on the palate after the coffee is spit out or swallowed. A short or unpleasant aftertaste isn’t desirable.

### <em>Acidity</em>
“Acidity” is a very desirable quality in a coffee, and is described as “brightness” when positive, or when contributing to a coffee’s flavor experience; on the other hand, acidity can be described as “sour” if it’s a negative experience. Good acidity is one that enhances a coffee’s other qualities, such as sweetness, and brings the coffee to life. If acidity is overpowering or the dominant note, it’s generally not a quality that is sought after. An exception could be Kenyan coffees, which are known for their intense acidity.

### <em>Body</em>
This is a coffee’s texture or tactile qualities in the mouth. Body can be heavy, light, syrupy, silky, etc. Whether a coffee’s body is a negative or positive quality depends on how it interacts with a coffee’s other qualities. Both acidity and body are measured by intensity.

### <em>Balance</em>
“Balance” is the combination of the above characteristics and how harmoniously they interact.

### <em>Clean cup</em>
A coffee has a “clean cup” if no unusual or “non-coffee like” tastes or aromas (which could be a result of defects) interfere with a coffee’s taste or aftertaste.

### <em>Sweetness</em>
“Sweetness” in this context refers to a fullness of flavor and any obvious sweet flavors that a coffee has.
