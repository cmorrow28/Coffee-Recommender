Aside from Peet's, which is probably more so, the quintessential coffee for the West-Coast French-press experience: gritty, pungent, and stands up against almost anything you put in it. Unless things have changed recently, do not serve this coffee drip-brewed at a PTA buffet in New England.","The rest of the taste profile plays peek-a-boo around dominating carbon tones in this very dark roasted coffee.
