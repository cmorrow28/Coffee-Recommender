Tobacco, cedar and the mangolike fruit carry into a quiet finish.","This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 18 coffee on Coffee Reviews list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2017. An unusual coffee in several respects. Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called wet hulling. This is a particularly refined example of the type. In addition, this coffee was subjected to a deliberate aging process by being held for three years in a specialized warehouse in Singapore. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flatsided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different often better cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. This coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of aged, casked and specially cured coffees for Coffee Reviews May 2017 tasting report. Founded in 1995, Equator Coffees  Teas is a womenowned wholesale coffee roasting company that focuses on sustainability in coffeesourcing and business practices.

The producers Granja la Esperanza brought Gesha plant material from Panama, where this celebrated variety was first rediscovered, to Colombia, where they established it on their farm Cerro Azul. Some of the trees proved not to resemble the trees of the classic Gesha, however; they grew smaller and denser. The producers have given the name Enano or dwarf to this apparent hybrid of Gesha. Based on the slim evidence of the two samples of the Enano we have tested at Coffee Review, the result in the cup is a profile similar to the finest examples of bonafide Gesha, though perhaps a bit less intense in its Geshaness.
